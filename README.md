# Spotify-Data-Analysis-SQL
This project involves performing data exploration and analysis on a real-world Spotify music dataset using PostgreSQL. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset by leveraging SQL techniques including Window Functions, CTEs, Aggregations, and Filtering.
________________________________________
## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains various attributes of music tracks including:

â€¢	artist, track, album, album_type

â€¢	Audio features: danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo

â€¢	Metadata: duration_min, title, channel, views, likes, comments

â€¢	Flags: licensed, official_video

â€¢	stream, most_playedon, energyliveness (calculated)
________________________________________
## Key SQL Concepts Applied
â€¢	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

â€¢	Aggregation & Grouping

â€¢	Filtering & Conditions

â€¢	Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

â€¢	Window Functions (e.g., SUM() OVER, DENSE_RANK() OVER)

â€¢	Subqueries
________________________________________
## Analysis Highlights
1.	Tracks with over 1 Billion Streams
2.	Top Tracks by Energy and Danceability
3.	Total Comments for Licensed Tracks
4.	Tracks Streamed More on Spotify vs. YouTube
5.	Energy-to-Liveness Ratio > 1.2
6.	Cumulative Likes Ordered by Views
7.	Top 3 Most Viewed Tracks per Artist
8.	Liveness Scores Above Average
9.	Energy Range (Max - Min) Per Album

## Sample Advanced Queries
### 1. Top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
WITH CTE

 AS

(

SELECT

      artist,
	  track,
	  SUM(views) AS total_view,
	  DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY artist ORDER BY SUM(views) DESC) AS rank

FROM spotify

GROUP BY 1,2

)

 SELECT * FROM CTE

 WHERE rank <= 3;

### 2. Cumulative Likes by Views
SELECT

    track,
    views,
    likes,
    SUM(likes) OVER (ORDER BY views DESC) AS cumulative_likes
FROM spotify

GROUP BY 1, 2, 3;

### 3. Energy-to-Liveness Ratio
WITH CTE 

AS 

(

    SELECT
                track,
                energy,
                liveness,
                (energy / liveness) AS energy_to_liveness_ratio
    FROM spotify
)

SELECT

    track,
    energy_to_liveness_ratio
FROM CTE

WHERE energy_to_liveness_ratio > 1.2

    AND liveness <> 0;
